        “Climate change” and “global warming” are often used interchangeably but
        have distinct meanings. Similarly, the terms "weather" and "climate" are
        sometimes confused, though they refer to events with broadly different
        spatial- and timescales.

        Weather refers to atmospheric conditions that occur locally over short
        periods of time—from minutes to hours or days. Familiar examples include
        rain, snow, clouds, winds, floods or thunderstorms.<br /><br />
        Climate, on the other hand, refers to the long-term regional or even
        global average of temperature, humidity and rainfall patterns over
        seasons, years or decades.

        Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system
        observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to
        human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases
        heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere. The term is
        frequently used interchangeably with the term climate change, though the
        latter refers to both human- and naturally produced warming and the
        effects it has on our planet. It is most commonly measured as the
        average increase in Earth’s global surface temperature. <br /><br />
        Since the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have
        increased Earth’s global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius
        (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a number that is currently increasing by 0.2
        degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. It is unequivocal
        that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land.

        Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns
        that have come to define Earth’s local, regional and global climates.
        These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous
        with the term.<br /><br />
        Changes observed in Earth’s climate since the early 20th century are
        primarily driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning,
        which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s
        atmosphere, raising Earth’s average surface temperature. These
        human-produced temperature increases are commonly referred to as global
        warming. Natural processes can also contribute to climate change,
        including internal variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like El
        Niño, La Niña and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings
        (e.g., volcanic activity, changes in the Sun’s energy output, variations
        in Earth’s orbit).<br /><br />
        Scientists use observations from the ground, air and space, along with
        <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/climate-model/" target="_blank"
          >theoretical models</a
        >, to monitor and study past, present and future climate change. Climate
        data records provide evidence of climate change key indicators, such as
        global land and ocean temperature increases; rising sea levels; ice loss
        at Earth’s poles and in mountain glaciers; frequency and severity
        changes in extreme weather such as hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires,
        droughts, floods and precipitation; and cloud and vegetation cover
        changes, to name but a few.
